Ingredients:
10 oz. Basa fish fillet, cut into pieces
1 1/2 tablespoons oil
2- inch ginger, skin peeled and cut into thin slices
2 stalks scallion, cut into 2-inch lengths (5 cm)

Marinade:
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine

Sauce:
1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon oyster sauce
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
3-4 tablespoons water
Salt to taste
3 dashes white pepper powder

Instructions:
Step 1: Marinate the fish for about 10 minutes. Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Step 2: Heat up the wok with cooking oil. Add ginger slices to the wok when the oil is very hot. Stir-fry the ginger until aromatic, then add the fish fillet. Stir-fry the fish until it is half cooked.

Step 3: Add the sauce and continue to stir-fry until the fish is cooked through. If the sauce dries out, add a little water. Add the chopped scallions and stir briefly. Dish out and serve hot.

Notes:
-Using fresh ginger and scallions will enhance the flavor of the dish. Avoid using old or wilted ingredients.

-Opt for firm-fleshed fish fillets like Basa, tilapia, or cod that can withstand stir-frying without falling apart.

-Make sure your wok or pan is hot enough before adding ingredients. This helps to quickly stir-fry and sear the fish without overcooking.

-If the sauce becomes too thick or dries out during cooking, add a splash of water to adjust the consistency.
