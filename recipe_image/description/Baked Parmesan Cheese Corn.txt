Ingredients：
2 cans sweet whole kernel corn, drained
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
2 teaspoons sugar
1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided
Parsley flakes, for garnish

Instructions：
Step1: Preheat the oven to 380°F (198°C). In a large bowl, combine 2 cans of sweet corn, mayonnaise, ground black pepper, garlic salt, sugar, grated Parmesan cheese, and half of the shredded Parmesan cheese. Stir well with a spatula.

Step 2: Pour the mixture into a baking dish and sprinkle the remaining shredded Parmesan cheese on top.

Step 3: Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Step 4: Remove from the oven and serve immediately, garnished with additional shredded Parmesan cheese and parsley flakes, if desired.

Notes:
-To make this dish creamer, you may substitute one can of sweet whole-kernel corn with cream-style corn to add richness.

-Add a cheesy topping to the dish with more kinds of cheese. You may broil the dish for an extra 5 minutes with a cup of mozzarella cheese evenly sprinkled on top. Let the cheese melt and drizzle down.

-Give the dish a spicy kick with some paprika sprinkled on top before serving.
