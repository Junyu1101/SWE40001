Ingredients:
1 pack spring roll wrappers
3 tablespoons cooking oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped finely
150 g (5 oz) chicken meat, chopped finely
150 g (5 oz) baby shrimp, chopped finely
5-6 dried shitake mushrooms, soaked and chopped finely
200 g (7 oz) yam bean, sliced
100 g (3½ oz) carrot, sliced

Seasonings:
1 teaspoon chicken stock granules
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash pepper
1 cup water
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch, mix with water

lour Mixture:
2 tablespoons plain flour
4 tablespoons water

Instructions:
Step 1: In a wok, heat the cooking oil. Add the garlic and stir-fry until aromatic. Then, add the chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms, and continue to stir-fry until cooked.

Step 2：Add the yam bean and carrot, and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Then, add 1 cup of water, cover with a lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add the seasoning ingredients and mix well. Dish out and set aside.

Step 3: Place a piece of spring roll wrapper on a flat surface. Add 2 spoonfuls of filling to the center of the wrapper, then fold in the two sides and roll it up. Use the flour mixture to seal the edges.

Step 4: Heat a wok and pour in 2 cups of cooking oil. Deep fry the spring rolls over medium heat until golden brown and crispy. Remove them and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with chili sauce.

Notes:
-When you’re adding the filling to the wrappers, keep it simple—don’t overstuff! When you’re adding the filling to the wrappers, keep it simple—don’t overstuff! Two spoonfuls is just right; otherwise, it gets messy.

-Keep an eye on your oil temperature at around 350°F (175°C) while frying. If it’s too hot, the outside will burn before the inside cooks, and if it’s too cool, your popiah will soak up too much oil and get greasy.

-Don’t overcrowd the pan! Frying in small batches helps everything cook evenly and stay nice and crispy.
