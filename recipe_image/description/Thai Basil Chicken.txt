Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
10 oz (280g) ground chicken
1 fresh red chili, sliced into pieces
6 bird's eye chilies, pounded and bruised (or 1-2 fresh jalapeno cut into slivers)
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce , Thailand Nguan Chiang brand Original Sweet Soy Sauce or ABC Sweet Sauce or Kecap Manis
1 tablespoon Thai palm sugar , or sugar
1/4 cup water
1 cup Thai basil leaves, stems removed
3 dashes ground white pepper
1 teaspoon Maggi sauce , or Thai Golden Mountain Seasoning Sauce, optional

Instructions:
Step 1:Add the oil to a heated wok, then add the chopped garlic and shallots. Stir fry until aromatic.

Step 2: Add the ground chicken and use a spatula to quickly stir fry, breaking the meat into small lumps.

Step 3： When the chicken turns white, add the chilies, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, sugar, and water. Stir to combine well. Add the basil leaves and stir quickly until they wilt and release their fragrant aroma.

Step 4: Add the white pepper, give the dish a few quick stirs, then dish out and serve immediately with steamed rice and a fried egg.

Notes
-Prep everything first. Chop and measure all your ingredients before you start cooking since it all comes together quickly.

-Crank up the heat. Use high heat for stir frying to cook the chicken fast and get all those flavors mingling.

-Don’t crowd the pan. If you’re making a big batch, cook in parts so you get a nice stir fry instead of steaming everything.

-Adjust the spice level. Like it milder or hotter? Add less or more bird’s eye chilies to get the spice level just right.

-Use dark soy sauce for color. Add a splash of dark soy sauce if you want a richer color in your dish.
