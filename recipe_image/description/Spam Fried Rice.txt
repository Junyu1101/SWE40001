Seasonings:
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

Step 1: Break up the lumpy overnight rice using the back of a spoon, a fork, or your hand. In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients for the Seasonings.

Step 2: Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in a wok over high heat and cook the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula. Set aside. Reheat the wok with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and stir-fry the garlic until aromatic.
